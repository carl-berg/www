I have worked as a systems developer since 2007 in different projects and with customers from a wide array of sectors. My role varies from project to project but includes Project manager, Architect, Team lead, Developer, Tester and Mentor.

I work with backend development in the [.net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com) stack, nowadays paired with quite a bit of javascript. Previously [knockout.js](https://knockoutjs.com) and [angular.js](https://angularjs.org), more recently with [react.js](https://reactjs.org). The projects are mostly web related and usually sprinkled with a few system integrations here and there.

I am an early adopter of new technologies, I am passionate about clean code and try to apply test driven development whenever i can.

I also work on and contribute to open source projects like:

- [Appeaser](https://github.com/carl-berg/appeaser)
- [Spinit library](https://github.com/Spinit-AB/Spinit)
- [Web anchor](https://github.com/mattiasnordqvist/Web-Anchor)
- [Captain data](https://github.com/mattiasnordqvist/Captain-Data)
- [Galactic waste management](https://github.com/mattiasnordqvist/Galactic-Waste-Management)
