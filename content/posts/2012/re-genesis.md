It's been a long-long time now  since i last posted something on this blog and i think it's time for me to get cracking again.

Since i wrote my last blog post about webforms mvp, I've been diving deeper into test driven development and started exploring some BDD/Specification by example -testing. There are alot of interesting frameworks for testing out there, but i got started with StoryQ, mainly because it doesn't need to be installed to be working with it.

So first up i'm planning to write a couple of posts on testing BDD style with StoryQ.
